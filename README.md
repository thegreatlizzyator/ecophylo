## Installation ##

To install this package, you can either download the tar.gz file in the dist directory of the repository :
```shell
python3 -m pip install <path_to>/ecophylo-<VERSION>.tar.gz
``` 

or install from the Python Package index (Pypi) :

```shell
python3 -m pip install ecophylo
``` 

or install from github (it does not work for private repository):

```shell
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/thegreatlizzyator/ecophylo/tree/packaging/dist/ecophylo-0.0.5.tar.gz
```
<!---
TODO : check if better way to check on dependencies
-->
To end the installation please check for the dependencies. In python you can check the dependencies like this :
```python
# dependencies
import msprime
import numpy as np
import sys
from ete3 import Tree
import pandas as pd
```

You can install them by running (numpy is an example):
```shell
python3 -m pip install numpy
```
You can experiment difficulties for installing msprime, check the help [here][msprime]

### Installation and usage in R (on Windows aka the painfull way)

> For FranÃ§ois : First create a new project in rstudio with **version control** from the [github](https://github.com/thegreatlizzyator/ecophylo). 

You will need to install `{reticulate}` package and python dependencies.

```r
# NOT RUN
install.packages('reticulate') # answer yes
library(reticulate)
# python dependencies
conda_install('r-reticulate', c('msprime','ete3','pandas'))
```

## Running ##

### In python

In python ( version >= 3.6) you can simulate trees using this package main function in python. 
```python
from ecophylo import dosimuls
dosimuls(nsim = 5, sample_size = 100, comprior = [1000,10e9], muprior = [1e-6] , verbose = True)
```

Note that there is random events during the simulation that you can control by setting a seed :
```python
dosimuls(nsim = 5, sample_size = 100, comprior = [1000,10e9], muprior = [1e-6] , verbose = True, seed = 42)
dosimuls(nsim = 5, sample_size = 100, comprior = [1000,10e9], muprior = [1e-6] , verbose = True, seed = 42)
```

### In R

**A vignette is being written at this moment.**
