Small bit of code to help debug. Objective is to regroup here all examples of the python code.

# toPhylo.py

Work with python tree.

```{python}
from ete3 import Tree
tree = Tree()
# We create a random tree topology
tree.populate(5)
print(tree)
```


init parameters of 

```{python}

node = tree.get_tree_root()

mu = 0
seed = 42

lambd = node.dist * mu

```

```{python}
def sizes2rates(init_size, past_sizes, times):
    """
    Compute the growth rates corresponding to a set of past sizes at different 
    times for a single population with a given initial size

    Parameters
    ----------
    init_size : int
        positive value
        the initial size of the population
    past_sizes: list of int
        positive values
        the sizes of the population in the past
        # TODO : should have the same length as time 
    times : list of int
        times at which the population size changes
        # TODO : should have the same length as t past_sizes

    Returns
    -------
    a list object containing the different growth rates of a given population
    at each given time period
    
    Examples
    -------
    >>> print("test")
    "no"
