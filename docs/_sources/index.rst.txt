ecophylo: Simulating and assessing eco-evolutionary dynamics under past environmental changes in Python
=======================================================================================================

Ecophylo is dedicated to coalescent-based simulation of eco-evolutionary dynamics. Species assemblages and their shared ancestry can be simulated by jointly taking into account the influence of past demographic fluctuations and extinctions along with how divergent genotypes have introduced new species over time through speciation.
